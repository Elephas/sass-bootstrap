Often this is caused by misspelling the reference\n      name, unencoded ampersands, or by leaving off the trailing semicolon (;).\n      <strong>The most common cause of this error is unencoded ampersands in\n      URLs</strong> as described by the <a\n        href=\"http://www.htmlhelp.com/\">WDG</a> in \"<a\n        href=\"http://www.htmlhelp.com/tools/validator/problems.html#amp\">Ampersands\n        in URLs</a>\".\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Entity references start with an ampersand (&amp;) and end with a\n      semicolon (;). If you want to use a literal ampersand in your document\n      you must encode it as \"&amp;amp;\" (<em>even inside URLs!</em>). Be\n      careful to end entity references with a semicolon or your entity\n      reference may get interpreted in connection with the following text.\n      Also keep in mind that named entity references are case-sensitive;\n      &amp;Aelig; and &amp;aelig; are different characters.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      If this error appears in some markup generated by PHP's session handling\n      code, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/QA/2005/04/php-session\" \n      title=\"Ampersands, PHP Sessions and Valid HTML\">this article</a> has \n      explanations and solutions to your problem.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Note that in most documents, errors related to entity references will\n      trigger up to 5 separate messages from the Validator. Usually these\n      will all disappear when the original problem is fixed.\n    </p>\n  </div>\n","type":"info","subtype":"warning"},{"lastLine":650,"lastColumn":115,"message":"general entity \"amp\" not defined and no default entity","messageid":"25","explanation":"    <p class=\"helpwanted\">\n      <a\n        href=\"feedback.html?uri=;errmsg_id=25#errormsg\"\n\ttitle=\"Suggest improvements on this error message through our feedback channels\" \n      >&#x2709;</a>\n    </p>\n\n    <div class=\"ve mid-25\">\n    <p>\n      This is usually a cascading error caused by a an undefined entity\n      reference or use of an unencoded ampersand (&amp;) in an URL or body\n      text.
